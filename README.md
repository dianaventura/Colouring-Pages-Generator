# Project Overview 🎨

Create an AI tool that converts images into coloring pages using edge detection and image processing techniques. This project aims to pave the way for advanced AI applications in personalized and enhanced artistic creation.

## Objectives 🖌️

1. **Basic Coloring Page Generation**:
   - Convert images into basic line art for coloring pages.
   
2. **Creative Line Art Generation**:
   - Develop a model for creative line art using public datasets.

3. **Personalized Line Art Generation**:
   - Train a model on the artist’s own doodles to reflect their unique style.

## Learning Goals 📚

- **Image Processing Techniques**:
  - Implement grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and Canny edge detection using OpenCV.
  
- **AI and Machine Learning in Art**:
  - Explore AI's role in analyzing and replicating artistic styles.
  - Learn about creating personalized AI models based on individual artists' work.

- **Impact of AI on Artistic Creation**:
  - Investigate how AI can augment, not replace, the creative process by identifying patterns and techniques in an artist's work.

## Ideal Outcome 🌟

Develop a comprehensive AI tool enabling artists to create personalized AI models. These models can generate new artworks or enhance existing ones, allowing artists to explore and expand their creative potential.
