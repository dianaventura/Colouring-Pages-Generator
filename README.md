## Objectives üñåÔ∏è

1. **Basic Colouring Page Generation**:
   - Convert images into basic line art for coloring pages.
   
2. **Creative Line Art Generation**:
   - Develop a model for creative line art using public datasets.

3. **Personalized Line Art Generation**:
   - Train a model on the my own doodles to reflect my style and explore potential.

## Learning Goals üìö

- **Image Processing Techniques**:
  - Implement grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and Canny edge detection using OpenCV.
  
- **AI and Machine Learning in Art**:
  - Explore AI's role in analysing and replicating artistic styles.
  - Learn about creating personalised AI models based on individual artists' work.

- **Impact of AI on Artistic Creation**:
  - Investigate how AI can augment, not replace, the creative process by identifying patterns and techniques in an artist's work.

## Ideal Outcome üåü

Develop a comprehensive AI tool enabling artists to create personalised AI models. These models can generate new artworks or enhance existing ones, allowing artists to explore and expand their creative potential.

## Potential Impact üöÄ

### For Artists:
- Empower artists to explore creative potential through AI.
- Provide tools to analyse and improve techniques.
- Enable creation of personalised, AI-generated artworks.

### For the Creative Industry:
- Enhance the quality and appeal of visual content.
- Provide insights into what makes certain artworks resonate with audiences.
- Open new avenues for interactive and personalised artistic experiences.
