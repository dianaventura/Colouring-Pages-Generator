# Project Overview üé®

Creating an AI tool that converts my own images into coloring pages using edge detection and image processing techniques. This project aims to explore advanced AI applications for personalised and enhanced artistic creation.

## Objectives üñåÔ∏è

1. **Basic Colouring Page Generation**:
   - Convert images into basic line art for coloring pages.
   
2. **Creative Line Art Generation**:
   - Develop a model for creative line art using public datasets.

3. **Personalized Line Art Generation**:
   - Train a model on the my own doodles to reflect my style and explore potential.

## Learning Goals üìö

- **Image Processing Techniques**:
  - Implement grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and Canny edge detection using OpenCV.
  
- **AI and Machine Learning in Art**:
  - Explore AI's role in analysing and replicating artistic styles.
  - Learn about creating personalized AI models based on individual artists' work.

- **Impact of AI on Artistic Creation**:
  - Investigate how AI can augment, not replace, the creative process by identifying patterns and techniques in an artist's work.

## Ideal Outcome üåü

Develop a comprehensive AI tool enabling artists to create personalized AI models. These models can generate new artworks or enhance existing ones, allowing artists to explore and expand their creative potential.

## Potential Impact üöÄ

### For Artists:
- Empower artists to explore creative potential through AI.
- Provide tools to analyze and improve techniques.
- Enable creation of personalized, AI-generated artworks.

### For the Creative Industry:
- Enhance the quality and appeal of visual content.
- Provide insights into what makes certain artworks resonate with audiences.
- Open new avenues for interactive and personalized artistic experiences.
